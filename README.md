## Project Description
This project aimed to fill a gap where people did not have low-price (free!) investment tracking and management available all in one place. We aimed to solve that by providing a solution that allows users to track all their investments in one dashboard.

## Technologies
We developed this project in JavaScript using a combination of **React** for the frontend and **Express** for the backend. We used **MongoDB** for our database.

## How to Run the Project
This app requires **two terminals** to run â€” one for the frontend and one for the backend.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed  
- MongoDB installed and running locally (or use MongoDB Atlas)  
- *(Optional)* `nodemon` for live server reloading
